        "Deep learning is the subfield of machine learning that concerns neural networks with representation learning capabilities. As of recent years, it is arguably the most quickly growing field within machine learning, enjoying major breakthroughs every year (Listing a couple ones from last year(s): ChatGPT, AlphaFold v2, DALL·E 2, AlphaZero). Although the popularity of neural nets is a recent phenomenon, they were first described by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943. Early progress in training competitive neural networks was stalled by a multitude of reasons, such as the limited computer resources, sub-optimal network architectures and the use of smaller datasets. In this PC-lab we will introduce you to the basics of implementing a neural network using contemporary practices."

To obtain the *deep learning magic*, we need to make the whole thing **non-linear**. We do this by adding **activation functions** after every (hidden) layer. The most classical activation is the sigmoid activation $\\sigma()$, used also in logistic regression. Nowadays, we usually opt for a more simple activation function: the **ReLU** $\\texttt{ReLU}(z) = max(0,z)$. This function has the favorable property that its derivative is very efficient to compute (1 when $z$ is positive, 0 when it is negative). It also acts as a switch: a neuron will have a \"dead\" ($0$) activation whenever $z$ is negative.\n",

For regression, we simply do not use an activation (or a custom one depending on your data: if you already know that your outputs can't be negative but can take all positive numbers ($\\mathbb{R}^+$), then maybe a ReLU activation in the output nodes makes sense)"

        "In one of the previous exercises, we already implemented a model compatible with MNIST: 784 input features and 10 output nodes (one for each class). Hence, we can move on to loss function and optimizers. For multi-class classification of the digits, we will need to use the [Cross Entropy Loss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html#torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss). Take a look at what kind of inputs this loss function expects. According to the documentation: `The input is expected to contain raw, unnormalized scores for each class.` Meaning that we can pass logits directly to this loss function, and we do not have to apply a softmax operation ourselves.\n",

It is common practice to perform a pass through the whole validation set after every training epoch. However, we should not compute gradients now, we can block automatic gradient computation using `torch.no_grad()`. Also, we need to tell PyTorch to put our model in evaluation mode (so it does not perform dropout anymore, etc...). After the validation epoch, we should put the model back to training mode again.
