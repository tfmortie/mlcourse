    "\n",
    "### Classification Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lab session, the iris flower data set was explored. Imagine now the case that for a \n",
    "new iris flower, we know its respective characteristics (sepal and petal length?height, respectively),\n",
    "but do not know its species. A natural task would be to assign the flower to one of the three possible species, based on its characteristics (features). This task (or problem) is called a \n",
    "<strong> classification problem. </strong> In this practical session, an algorithm to solve this problem by looking at the closest training examples in the (labeled) dataset is described.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "In the iris flower dataset (iris120.csv), each instance (i.e. flower) is described by 5 attributes:\\\n",
    "sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and species.\n",
    "For the matter of simplicity, we will only use the species, sepal length and sepal width. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "These properties can be seen as _variables_, and for a given flower, each of these variables takes a specific\n",
    "value. In a classification setting, the aim is to predict the value of one of the variables (here the species), based on the value of the other variables (here sepal width and length). The variable of which the values have to be predicted is called the _output variable_ and the variables used to make this prediction are called the _input variables_ or _features_. \\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "A dataset $\\mathcal{D}$ consists of a set of $n$ observations of input-output couples $(\\boldsymbol{x_i}, y_i)$, where $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n \\}$. Here, $\\boldsymbol{x_i} = (x_{i1}, \\dots, x_{ip}))^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$\n",
    "are the observed values for the features (with $p$ the number of features), and $y_i$ are the observed output values, such that a training dataset $\\mathcal{D}_{train}$ with $n$ instances can be written as\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{D}_{train} = \\{ (\\boldsymbol{x_1}, y_1), \\dots, (\\boldsymbol{x_n}, y_n) \\}. $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "### Model and Problem Setup\n",
    "Using the dataset, the goal is to build a _model_ $f$ that is able to predict the value of the output variable, given the value of the input variables. \\\n",
    "In our iris classification problem, both input variables take real values ($x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n \\}$), whereas the output variable is nominal, taking values from the finite set $\\{setosa, versicolor, virginica\\}$. Hence, the model $f$ we are looking for is a mapping $$f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\rightarrow \\{setosa, versicolor, virginica\\}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nearest neighbour classification\n",
    "\n",
    "A very simple technique to derive a classifier model from a given training dataset is the _nearest neighbour algorithm_. It departs from the assumption that instances whose features are highly similar are more likely to have the same label than those with very different features.\\\n",
    "In particular, the _k-nearest neighbors algorithm_ for classification classifies an instance by a plurality vote of its $k$ closest neighbours. If $k=1$, the model applies this idea in its most extreme from: the label is predicted as the label of the closest instance in the training dataset.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "In order to select the 'closest' instances in the training set, a suitable measure of distance $d(x_i, x_j)$ between two instances $x_i$ and $x_j$ is used. In our case, we will simply use the Euclidean distance:\n",
    "$$ d_E (x_i, x_j) = \\sqrt{\\sum_{k=1}^p (x_{i,k} - x_{j,k})^2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this distance measure, the ($1$-) nearest neighbor algorithm consists of the following steps: \\\n",
    "1. For an instance with unknown label and known feature vector $\\boldsymbol{x}$, calculate the distance to each instance in the dataset: $d_E(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{x_i})$ where $i = 1, ... ,n.$\n",
    "2. Select the closest instance and take its label as the prediction for the unknown label.\n",
    "\n"
